# stock-evaluator
A personal project of mine that scrapes live and historical stock data, as well as financial data about companies to evaluate a publicly offered stock as a good or bad short and long term investment. Still in progress.

Once completed, the evaluator will detail recent activity about the stock, compare its financial data to others in the industry as well as general company health standards, evaluate the short and long term price trend of the stock, and offer a short and long term recommendation for investing in it.

Live stock data, historical stock data, and companies' financial data are scraped from Yahoo! Finance. A table with industry financial ratios are pulled from http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/datafile/pedata.html (NYU Stern) for comparison.
